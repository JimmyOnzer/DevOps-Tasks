## 1 What is your understanding of a DevOps Culture in an Organization


DevOps is a cultural view of how everyone works right. In the software-defined world, many questions arise. How to get your product to production quickly and when will it go into production? How do I know if I found the best solution? How quickly can I apply improvements and updates? DevOps seeks to engage everyone interested in the game and engage them early  in the collaborative process. Achieving this success with DevOps starts with understanding the key business benefits. Organizations can run faster with less downtime and less security concerns.

A DevOps culture is based on a shared understanding between developers and operations and a shared responsibility for the software they create. This means greater transparency, communication and collaboration in development, IT/operations and business. This helps companies align their people, processes, and tools toward a more unified customer focus. 

A DevOps culture blurs the lines between developer, operator, and QA roles. Implementing DevOps requires  significant changes in the way people work with each other and how organizations contribute to the necessary cultural change.
